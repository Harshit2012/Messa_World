### Cloning Your Fork

To clone your forked repository, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Harshit2012/Messa_World.git
cd repository-name
```

## Syncing Your Fork
To sync your fork with the original repository, you’ll need to add the original repository as an upstream remote:
```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Harshit2012/Messa_World.git
```

**Fetch the branches and their respective commits from the upstream repository:**

```bash
git fetch upstream
```

**Check out your fork’s local default branch - usually main:**

```bash
git checkout main
```

**Merge the changes from the upstream default branch - usually main:**

```bash
git merge upstream/main
```

Now, your local default branch is up-to-date with the original repository’s default branch.
